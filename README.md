# 🧠 MorphoGuard — AI-Powered Ethical Ultrasound Scanner

### 🚀 A Firebase AI Studio Project | Built by Team Hacknotics

---

## 🌍 Overview

**MorphoGuard** is an AI-driven healthcare solution designed to automatically detect and blur fetal gender-identifying regions in ultrasound scans.  
It addresses the pressing ethical issue of **illegal prenatal gender determination**, promoting gender equity and responsible medical practice.  

By integrating with **portable ultrasound devices**, **Firebase AI**, and **geo-fencing**, MorphoGuard ensures that scans are processed securely and ethically — preventing gender detection in regions where it is restricted by law.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Prenatal gender determination is a major cause of **female feticide** and **gender imbalance** in many regions.  
Despite legal restrictions, misuse of ultrasound technology continues.  
Healthcare systems need **AI-backed automation** to detect and prevent this issue at the source.

## 🧬 Solution — How MorphoGuard Works

1. **Upload Ultrasound Scan** — The doctor or operator uploads a scan.  
2. **AI Detection** — MorphoGuard’s AI model identifies fetal regions that reveal gender.  
3. **Automated Masking** — The AI automatically blurs or obscures those regions.  
4. **Geo-Fencing Compliance** — The app enforces local regulations based on device location.  
5. **Secure Storage** — Processed scans are saved on Firebase Storage, maintaining full patient confidentiality.
